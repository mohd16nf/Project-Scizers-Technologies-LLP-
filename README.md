This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Alright to run this project you can either clone this repo and then start it or if you are going to create a seperately folder for this project then follow these steps
1. Create these following components 1- Navbar, 2- ImageSlider 3- Lightbox , 4- Heropage , 5- Options , 6- Services and 7- Footer
2. keep all the components in the same component folder so there will be error for importing these components

4. Install these dependencies 1- autoprefixer 2- postcss 3- tailwindcss and 4- react-icons these will make sure that you dont get any error related to dependencies installation.
5. once all these steps are completed then simply import all the components in main file paje.js and run the application.


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
